Simple example of using tobii_research module (Tobii Pro SDK) in a PsychoPy demo project.
Little code snippets were added in the builder that would:
- Look for a connected eye tracker
- Connect to the first one in the list (in case more than one eye tracker is available)
- Add gaze data to a list
- Write the list to a csv file at the end of the experiment

To run this demo one should also download the "stims" folder and three CSV files from the PsychoPy repository, which can be found on this link:
